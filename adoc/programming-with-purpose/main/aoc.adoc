== Rethinking Advent of Code: coding for purpose during the holidays

The Advent of Code is a widely celebrated event in the programming community. Every December, coders from around the world tackle creative, fun, and challenging puzzles, honing their skills and competing with friends or strangers online. It’s an engaging tradition—but I believe it holds an unrealized potential.

What if, instead of focusing solely on solving leet-code-like puzzles, we used this same energy to make a tangible impact? The holiday season could become a time to leverage our coding skills for a greater purpose, helping others learn to code or applying our talents to projects that solve real-world problems.

=== Why Advent of Code is good

**Skill building**: Advent of Code’s puzzles challenge your problem-solving abilities and help you think algorithmically. It’s a fantastic way to improve as a programmer.

**Community engagement**: The event fosters a sense of camaraderie among participants, with people sharing solutions, tips, and encouragement.

**Creative Problem Solving**: The puzzles encourage thinking outside the box, which can translate to innovative approaches in real-world coding tasks.

=== What Advent of Code could be

While Advent of Code is undeniably valuable, its format could inspire more purpose-driven contributions during the holiday season. Here’s how:

==== Helping others learn to code

**Mentorship**: Use the Advent of Code puzzles as teaching tools for beginner coders. Pair up with someone just starting their journey, walking them through problem-solving techniques.

**Community workshops**: Host live coding sessions or workshops in your local area or online. Use the puzzles as a gateway to teach programming fundamentals.

**Content creation**: Create tutorials, blog posts, or videos explaining solutions to Advent of Code problems in a beginner-friendly way. This helps others grow while reinforcing your own knowledge.

==== Applying skills to real-world problems

**Contributing to open source**: Dedicate time to open-source projects addressing social, environmental, or humanitarian issues. Platforms like GitHub are filled with projects that need contributors.

**Hackathons for good**: Organize or participate in holiday hackathons focused on creating tools or software that benefit underserved communities or tackle pressing global challenges.

**Building useful tools**: Instead of solving theoretical puzzles, identify a need in your community or workplace and create something that solves a practical problem. It could be as simple as an app to organize food drives or as complex as an open-source healthcare tracker.

=== Coding with purpose

The spirit of the holidays is about giving, connection, and making a positive impact. While solving puzzles is fun, we have the chance to align our efforts with this spirit by helping others and addressing real-world needs. Imagine the impact if even a fraction of the Advent of Code participants dedicated their skills to mentoring or community-focused projects.

So this year, as you tackle those puzzles, think about how you might also tackle problems beyond the keyboard. Coding with purpose isn’t just empowering for you—it can change lives. Let’s make this season one of meaningful impact.
