== Install Neovim (optional)

Vim is fine to get started coding, but Neovim, the modern spiritual descendent of Vim, is a cleaner experience at the cost of a little unnoticeable bloat. Notably, Neovim has a cleaner help interface and dynamic error displays. It is also far more extensible when such makes sense laterâ€”particularly for those use the same computer for most of their work. This guide walk you through installing Neovim on Mac, Windows, and Linux using the package manager.

[NOTE]
====
Notice how similar these workflows are with modern package managers. All operating systems have finally caught up to using a package manager for software installation and management. Becoming proficient with them is therefore mandatory for any serious tech professional.

**Mac with brew**:

Run the following commands one at a time:

[source, shell]
----
brew install neovim
nvim --version
nvim
----

Later after you run `cm init` (not yet) the `vi` command will automatically detect `nvim` and start that, otherwise it will run just `vim` or the actual `vi`.

**Windows with winget**:

Run the following commands one at a time:

[source, shell]
----
winget install Neovim.Neovim
nvim --version
nvim
----

**Linux with apt**:

Run the following commands one at a time:

[source, shell]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y neovim
nvim --version
nvim
----
