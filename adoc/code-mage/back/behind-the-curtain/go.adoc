== Install the Go compiler

You'll need the Go compiler to turn your code into runnable commands. Go is available for all operating systems via the package manager for each:

**Mac**:

[source,shell]
----
brew install go
go version
----

**Windows**:

[source,shell]
----
winget install --id GoLang.Go -e
go version
----

**Linux**:

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt install golang
go version
----

[NOTE]
====
These installs with the package manager should be getting a bit easier at this point, which is good because you'll be doing this all the time as a code mage and tech professional.
