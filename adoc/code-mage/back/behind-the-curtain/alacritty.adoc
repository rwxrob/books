== Install Alacritty terminal

Alacritty is a modern, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator known for its speed and simplicity. It's speed and support for millions of colors make it particularly good for creating performant terminal animations and games, which always make fun micro-projects when learning the coding fundamentals. This guide walks you through installing Alacritty on Mac, Windows, and Linux by downloading the official installers from the Alacritty GitHub repository.

**Linux**:

If you managed to install Linux you probably already have a package manager and can just use that to install Alacritty instead. Open the built-in terminal and enter the following commands:

[source,shell]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt install alacritty
----

[NOTE]
====
Only Linux distributions like Linux Mint, Ubuntu, and Debian that use `apt` package manager are covered in this book.

=== Customize later

Don't worry about customization for now. Running `cm init` later will automatically configure the Alacritty teminal to startup up with a nice theme and font and reasonable defaults. You can always come back and update them in `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml` file later.
