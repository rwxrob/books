== Greet (hello world)

Cast your first spell to greet the world of magic and code! This cantrip sets the tone for your magical journey ahead, giving acolytes like you a satisfying first success invoking code magic. "Hello World" is recognized across the realm as the first spell most mages will ever cast and continues to be a strong tradition today.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You should already feel completely comfortable opening, editing, and saving a file before doing this first spell. If not go back to <<learnvim, Learn Vim>> until you have mastered the basics.
====

**Task**:

Print something to the terminal console for the user to read.

**Topics**:

`go run` â€¢ `go build` â€¢ `go mod init` â€¢ `go install` â€¢ `main` â€¢ `string` â€¢ `fmt` â€¢ `// comment`

**Example**:

First make a directory called `hello` and change into it. If you don't remember how, go back and refresh <<learn-shell, your basic shell skills>> from the previous section.

Now type the following code into a file called `main.go` (ignore the numbered circles, for now):

[source, go]
----
package main                          <1>

import "fmt"                          <2>

func main() {                         <3>
    // fmt.Println("Hello, World!")  <4> <5>
    fmt.Println("Hello, ä¸–ç•ŒðŸŒŽ")       <6>
}
----

At this point you have three choices:

. Just run it: `go run main.go`
. Build and run it here: `go build; ./hello`
. Make it a mod, install, run: `go mod hello; go install; hello`

I see sparks and a greeting appear out of the ether! Your first cantrip is cast. Congratulations!

[TIP]
====
Never written code before? If so, mark this date on your calendar as your _code birthday_. You'll want to remember it one day.
====

Let's decipher the glyphs of your spell:

<1> Declares this file is package `main` which is where the action is.

<2> Imports the standard `fmt` package containing `Println`.

<3> Declares special `main` function, every program must have one.

<4> Prints "Hello, World!" to the console with a new line at the end.

<5> Use `//` to deactivate code or "comment it out".

<6> Unicode (emojis, languages) are supported by the language.

[NOTE]
====
Rob Pike and Ken Thompson (two of Go's inventors) more or less invented Unicode as well, which is used for emojis and different languages. It's no surprise that, unlike other languages, Go has first-class support for these built into the language itself. ðŸ˜ƒ
====

**Challenges**:

- Write and run a program to print "Hello World!" to the screen.
- Alter the program to print hello in another language to the screen.
- Add an emoji of the world in the output.
- Delete the program and write another from scratch.

[TIP]
====
Now is the time to show what you have mastered to a mentor or friend who is learning with you. See what they have to say. Even though this is a small application, it's a good time to get in the habit of _peer review_ when another looks over it and validates it or gives feedback..
