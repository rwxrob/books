= Prepare to code

Learning happens in the lab, not the lecture hall. You can't make spells or swords without a lab or forge. So let's make one. Here's what we'll need:

- Bash command shell
- GitHub account
- Dotfiles configuration
- Wezterm terminal
- Neovim editor
- Go programming language
- Markdown for notes
- Git for saving and sharing

[CAUTION]
====
You don't need more than this. Avoid the temptation to customize everything for now. You'll have plenty of time to do that later.
