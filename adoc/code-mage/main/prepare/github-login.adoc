== Login to GitHub

When wielding the tools of a Code Mage, having direct access to GitHub is essential for managing repositories, collaborating with others, and conjuring new spells of code. The **GitHub CLI (`gh`)** is a powerful artifact in your magical arsenal, and to harness its full potential, you must first authenticate yourself.

Type the following command into the terminal followed by `Enter`:

[source,shell]
----
gh auth login
----

This command initiates the authentication process, prompting you with several options.

Select Github.com for _account_.

Select HTTPS for _preferred protocol_.

Type enter to accept _Authenticate Git with GitHub credentials_.

Type enter to accept _Login with a web browser_.

Copy or remember the _one-time_ code and press `Enter`.

Your web browser should open automatically.

[NOTE]
====
If your browser does not open automatically you can open it and go to `https://github.com/login/device` to do the same. By the way, this is one reason we used bash on the computer and not something else (like a virtual machine or container) that would not have been able to open the web browser.
====

Click _Continue_ if on web page.

Paste or type in the _one-time_ code and click _Continue_.

Review the permissions and grant access.

Follow any remaining authentication steps you have setup (two-factor authentication, etc.)

When the process is complete, the CLI will confirm that you are successfully logged in:

[source]
----
Logged in as <your_username>
----

To ensure your login worked, try the following commands:

[source, sh]
----
gh auth status
gh repo list
----

If these commands return results without errors, your login is successful, and youâ€™re ready to work your magic on GitHub!
