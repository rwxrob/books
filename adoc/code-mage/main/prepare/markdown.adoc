== Start notes in Markdown

In the journey of learning, problem-solving, and creating, taking notes is as important as casting spells to preserve fleeting thoughts. Whether you use a sophisticated digital tool or a simple piece of paper, the act of note-taking is a powerful practice that unlocks clarity, reinforces memory, and fosters creativity.

[CAUTION]
====
There are _a lot_ of note take apps, philosophies, and vampires who will suck all your life force attacking you about your note taking method. The best method is the one that is the easiest, most compatible, and simple. You can always try fancier things later, for not you need practice with Vim and Git and GitHub to stick with this method.
====

=== GitHub notes repo

The best way to manage knowledge is the same way we manage source code, with GitHub. Let's create a new repo for both our code and notes, we'll call it a `codebook` (but you can call it whatever you want):

[source, sh]
----
cd
gh repo create codebook --private --clone
cd codebook
----

Notice that the first `cd` has nothing after it. That automatically takes you home exactly like `cd ~` but just a lot easier to type.

Now let's create a `README.md` with the `touch` command:

[source, sh]
----
touch README.md
----

The `touch` command makes a new file if it does not exist or updates the time that it was last modified.

[TIP]
====
It is a good habit to use it to make new files so that you don't attempt to make one where you don't have permission only to realize after you are written a bunch of stuff that you don't have permission to save the file. If it sounds like that lesson came from years of mistakenly doing exactly that it did.
====

Now go head and put anything into the file and save it using the `git` command:

[source,sh]
----
git add .                     <1>
git commit -m 'add readme'    <2>
git push -u origin main       <3>
----

<1> Add everything in the current directory and below.
<2> Commit with a comment message.
<3> Push up to GitHub (first push always needs `-u origin main`)

The `README.md` is a special file. It is displayed automatically on GitHub when people visit that page. Let's open our graphic web browser and check it out:

[source, sh]
----
gh repo view --web
----

Nice! The spell book begins to take form.

=== Start using Markdown

You might have noticed the `.md` at the end and wondered what that was about. That's Markdown, a lightweight markup language that allows document formatting and such using nothing but a plain text editor. This page will guide you through the essential features of Markdown, helping you harness its potential for organizing and presenting information. Go ahead and practice it all taking notes as you go. You can repeat the steps for saving and pushing to view it on the web as you go to practice those commands.

[TIP]
====
Yes, there are many ways to dynamically preview Markdown while you are writing it. Forget about them all right now. You are _deliberately_ repeating that process of `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` until you dream of it in your sleep. Later you can look at other methods of previewing and reduce the number of commits if you really want to by making a PR, but that's getting way ahead of ourselves. Feels good knowing everything you are doing is the exact same professionals are doing thousands of times a day, just like me right now while I'm writing this.
====

Markdown is perfect for taking notes because of the following:

**Simplicity**: Markdown’s syntax is intuitive and easy to learn.

**Portability**: Notes in Markdown can be used across various platforms and converted to formats like HTML and PDF.

**Focus**: By removing the need for complex formatting tools, Markdown helps you concentrate on the content.

**Versatility**: Markdown works well for notes, documentation, blogs, and even presentations.

=== Basic Markdown syntax

[NOTE]
====
The word _syntax_ is a particularly important one. As a code mage you will see it a lot. It refers to the rules that govern the structure of statements or elements in a system. These rules determine how components (like words, symbols, or code) are arranged to create a valid expression or meaningful communication.
====

The following covers only the Markdown syntax basics which are also covered for https://docs.github.com/articles/markdown-basics[GitHub Flavored Markdown]. You _really_ don't need all that right now and you should be careful not to make your notes incompatible with another Markdown tool later that you might want to use.

[CAUTION]
====
Simple really is better here. After having to port my knowledge base of notes between several different systems and always being burned by slight incompatibilities making a ton of work to do the conversion I have learned that sticking with the least amount of Markdown customization and extensions is best. When writing books, however, there are other alternatives that are far more powerful than Markdown, such as AsciiDoc, which is what this book is written in.

**Headings**

Create headings by prefixing text with one to six hashtag `#` symbols (but preferably no more than three):

[source,markdown]
----
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
----

---

**Emphasis**

**Bold**: Surround text with double asterisks (`**`) or underscores (`__`) (but preferably `**`):

[source, markdown]
----
**bold text**
__bold text__
----

*Italic*: Surround text with single asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`) (but preferably `*`):

[source, markdown]
----
*italic text*
_italic text_
----

***Bold and Italic***: Combine both for extra emphasis:

[source, markdown]
----
***bold and italic text***
----

[CAUTION]
====
Be careful about mixing the these within the same span. Markdown renders don't really agree about how to handle that so error on the side of caution and avoid mixing them.
====

---

**Lists**

**Unordered Lists**: Use `-`, `*`, or `+` for bullet points (but preferably dash `-`). Use four spaces for indented sub-list items:

[source, markdown]
----
- Item 1
- Item 2
     - Sub-item 2.1
----

**Ordered Lists**: Use numbers followed by a period (just `1.` is fine):

[source, markdown]
----
1. First item
2. Second item
  1. Sub-item 2.1
----

---

**Links**

Create clickable links with the format:

[source, markdown]
----
[Link Text](https://example.com)
----

---

**Images**

Embed images using the same syntax as links, but prefix with an exclamation mark (`!`):

[source, markdown]
----
![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.png)
----

---

**Code**

**Inline Code**: Use backticks for short code snippets:

[source, markdown]
----
Here is some `inline code` in a sentence.
----

**Block Code**: Use triple backticks for multi-line code and the name of the syntax immediately after:

[source, markdown]
----
```go
func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello, Markdown!")
}
```
----

---

**Blockquotes**

Indent text with a `>` to create blockquotes. Keep paragraphs to a single long line wrapper than wrapping the text so that the source code itself displays well on any window or tmux pane of any size. Hard wraps never work well:

[source, markdown]
----
> This is a blockquote. It can span multiple lines.
----

---

**Separators**

Also called "horizontal rule" using three or more dashes (`—-`), or tildes (`~~~~`) (but preferably use exactly four to easily find them).

---

**Tables**

Create tables with pipes (`|`) and dashes:

[source,markdown]
----
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|———-|———-|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | More     |
----
