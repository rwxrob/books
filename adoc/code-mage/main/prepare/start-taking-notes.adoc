== Start taking notes

In the journey of learning, problem-solving, and creating, taking notes is as important as casting spells to preserve fleeting thoughts. Whether you use a sophisticated digital tool (like GitHub or Obsidian) or a simple piece of paper, the act of note-taking is a powerful practice that unlocks clarity, reinforces memory, and fosters creativity.

=== Why notes matter

**Preserving ideas**: Our minds are like flowing rivers of thought. Without notes, many brilliant ideas risk being swept away. Notes capture these ideas, making them tangible and retrievable.

**Enhancing memory**: The process of writing, even on paper, strengthens your ability to recall information. It’s an active engagement with the material that makes it stick.

**Organizing complexity**: Notes allow you to break down complex concepts into manageable pieces, creating a map that guides your understanding.

**Encouraging reflection**: By reviewing your notes, you can identify patterns, revisit insights, and refine your thinking over time.

=== The value of starting simple

You don’t need a perfect system to begin. Even a humble notebook can be your first spellbook. What matters is consistency and intent. Scribble ideas, sketch diagrams, or jot down questions—whatever helps you capture and organize your thoughts.

=== A note-taking habit for mages

**Always be ready**: Keep a notebook or a few blank sheets nearby, whether at your desk or on the go.

**Write what matters**: Focus on key points, insights, and actionable ideas rather than trying to transcribe everything.

**Review and reflect**: Set aside time to revisit your notes. What once seemed incomplete might spark new understanding.

=== From paper to systems

As your habit grows, you might find value in transitioning to a digital system that organizes your notes into searchable collections. But remember: the tool is less important than the practice. What matters most is capturing the magic of your thoughts, whether in ink or bytes.

Taking notes is not just about recording—it’s about thinking. With each word you write, you deepen your engagement with your learning, your ideas, and yourself. Start small, stay consistent, and watch as your notes become a treasure trove of inspiration and growth.

=== Start using Markdown

Your spell book will not just be written in Go, but also Markdown, a lightweight markup language that allows document formatting and such using nothing but a plain text editor. This page will guide you through the essential features of Markdown, helping you harness its potential for organizing and presenting information. Markdown is perfect for taking notes because of the following:

**Simplicity**: Markdown’s syntax is intuitive and easy to learn.

**Portability**: Notes in Markdown can be used across various platforms and converted to formats like HTML and PDF.

**Focus**: By removing the need for complex formatting tools, Markdown helps you concentrate on the content.

**Versatility**: Markdown works well for notes, documentation, blogs, and even presentations.

=== Basic Markdown syntax

[NOTE]
====
The word _syntax_ is a particularly important one. As a code mage you will see it a lot. It refers to the rules that govern the structure of statements or elements in a system. These rules determine how components (like words, symbols, or code) are arranged to create a valid expression or meaningful communication.
====

The following covers only the Markdown syntax basics which are also covered for https://docs.github.com/articles/markdown-basics[GitHub Flavored Markdown]. You _really_ don't need all that right now and you should be careful not to make your notes incompatible with another Markdown tool later that you might want to use.

[CAUTION]
====
Simple really is better here. After having to port my knowledge base of notes between several different systems and always being burned by slight incompatibilities making a ton of work to do the conversion I have learned that sticking with the least amount of Markdown customization and extensions is best. When writing books, however, there are other alternatives that are far more powerful than Markdown, such as AsciiDoc, which is what this book is written in.

**Headings**

Create headings by prefixing text with one to six hashtag `#` symbols (but preferably no more than three):

[source,markdown]
----
# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3
----

---

**Emphasis**

**Bold**: Surround text with double asterisks (`**`) or underscores (`__`) (but preferably `**`):

[source, markdown]
----
**bold text**
__bold text__
----

*Italic*: Surround text with single asterisks (`*`) or underscores (`_`) (but preferably `*`):

[source, markdown]
----
*italic text*
_italic text_
----

***Bold and Italic***: Combine both for extra emphasis:

[source, markdown]
----
***bold and italic text***
----

[CAUTION]
====
Be careful about mixing the these within the same span. Markdown renders don't really agree about how to handle that so error on the side of caution and avoid mixing them.

**Lists**

**Unordered Lists**: Use `-`, `*`, or `+` for bullet points (but preferably dash `-`). Use four spaces for indented sub-list items:

[source, markdown]
----
- Item 1
- Item 2
     - Sub-item 2.1
----

**Ordered Lists**: Use numbers followed by a period (just `1.` is fine):

[source, markdown]
----
1. First item
2. Second item
  1. Sub-item 2.1
----

---

**Links**

Create clickable links with the format:

[source, markdown]
----
[Link Text](https://example.com)
----

---

**Images**

Embed images using the same syntax as links, but prefix with an exclamation mark (`!`):

[source, markdown]
----
![Alt Text](https://example.com/image.png)
----

---

**Code**

**Inline Code**: Use backticks for short code snippets:

[source, markdown]
----
Here is some `inline code` in a sentence.
----

**Block Code**: Use triple backticks for multi-line code and the name of the syntax immediately after:

[source, markdown]
----
```go
func main() {
  fmt.Println("Hello, Markdown!")
}
```
----

---

**Blockquotes**

Indent text with a `>` to create blockquotes. Keep paragraphs to a single long line wrapper than wrapping the text so that the source code itself displays well on any window or tmux pane of any size. Hard wraps never work well:

[source, markdown]
----
> This is a blockquote. It can span multiple lines.
----

---

**Separators**

Also called "horizontal rule" using three or more dashes (`----`), or tildes (`~~~~`) (but preferably use exactly four to easily find them).

---

**Tables**

Create tables with pipes (`|`) and dashes:

[source,markdown]
----
| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     |
| Row 2    | More     |
----
