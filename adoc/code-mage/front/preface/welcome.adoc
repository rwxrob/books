Welcome to my how-to-be-an-awesome-coder-person book! The magic stuff is just to get you to pick it up and remember it.

Does it bother you that I'm referring to myself in the first-person? At least now you know. Get used to it. Or not. I think it just makes it more special, 'cuz _you_ are special.

[NOTE]

Can I help it if Fred Rogers raised me? Did you know Mr. Rogers middle name was actually McFeely in real life? I did not know until just now. Seems like a very unfortunate middle name for a person in his profession.

The truth is this book came from years of working with people in person. Obviously, you and I couldn't work together _right now_ so here we are, maybe one day. Until then, you can find me livestreaming most days on Twitch and YouTube (https://linktr.ee/rwxrob). Fair warning, it gets pretty crazy, but no unicorns, _I swear_.
