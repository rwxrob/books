== How to use this book

This book is designed to be read from top to bottom. The concepts build on one another. However, each "spell" is designed to be re-learned often like a mage preparing for a specific adventure. Повторение — мать учения. Repetition is the mother of learning. Anyone who has ever played any fantasy-themed game knows not all spells can be memorized and ready at all times, which is why you create your own book of coding spells while reading this book, just like an _actual_ spell caster would.
