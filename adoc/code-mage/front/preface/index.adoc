Welcome to my coding book! That's right. I'm writing to you in the first-person (think Deadpool). This feels like we are working on this stuff together, right? If that's not your thing at least now you know.

The truth is this book came from years of working directly with people just like you in person. Obviously, you and I couldn't work together _right now_ so here we are, maybe one day. Until then, you can find me livestreaming most days on Twitch and YouTube (https://linktr.ee/rwxrob). Fair warning, it gets pretty crazy, but no unicorns, _I swear_.
