= Changes for 2025

- Regular update videos on YouTube
- Banishing Bash
- Pumping up Perl
- Beautify Bonzai
- Claude for coding

== Banishing Bash

- Not as flexible or ubiquitous as POSIX
- Safer than POSIX but not as safe as `perl -T`
- Bloated with completely unnecessary stuff (100x > perl)
  - `-r-xr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   1.2M Aug  4 06:31 /bin/bash`
  - `-rwxr-xr-x  1 root  wheel   134K Aug  4 06:31 /usr/bin/perl`
- Sloooow, really slow (one reason `dash` was invented)
- Only integer math support
- Dependence on other external tools for text processing
- Bashisms aren't really that great
- Extended regular expressions are absolutely grotesque
- Using `/bin/sh` _is_ `/bin/bash` on some systems but POSIX limited

== Pumping up Perl

> "Perl is, by and large, a digested and simplified version of Unix. Perl is the Cliff Notes of Unix. I could never really get myself to learn sed, awk, zsh, grep, find, m4, pipes, xargs, tee, cut, paste, yacc, lex, various IPC or even C for that matter. I ought to. In practice, in almost all cases I use perl." - Larry Wall
