To Doris, my partner in world domination

= Preface

This is the autobiography of a life-long autodidact, polyglot, nefarious hacker, and ex-communicated Mormon; an attention starved, shameless narcissist and adulterer who finally realized it actually can be all about him and still be about all those around him.

The him in that sentence is me, rwxrob, but people have known me by many names:

- Mr. Rob
- Mo Hax
- ironmo (my secret name swapped around)
- Moroni (my super secret Mormon cult name)
- Роберт
- President Muhlestein
- Elder Muhlestein
- Brother Muhlestein
- Pokey the Knee-Rider (Poke, for short)
- Muhley
- Schnoz
- ... and several others that I cannot divulge for safety reasons.

[CAUTION]
====
Caution: the following contains ultra-secret Mormon temple rituals; explicit curse words; references to sex, drugs, and rock and roll; a bare nipple or two; and wanton disregard for propriety and decorum.

It's been a rough life for sure but not nearly as rough as others have had. All I can do, I suppose, is share what I've learned—most of it the hard way.

But do I really want to? Do I really want to write all this shit down? Do I want to drag it all out for the wild public to consume?

This book is really going to piss a lot of people off but I've never given less of a shit. That's the thing about hitting rock bottom and rebuilding from zero. You really do stop caring about perception management. Life is too precious and short to waste time pretending to be something you're not. If _anything_ I write saves another human from even the slightest bit of pain and suffering it will have been worth it all. I could give a fuck about bringing pain to those who mentally molested me for decades—or physically molested people I knew. But legally, I suppose I cannot use their names, unless, for example, they were on the 5-o'clock news because they were arrested in a pedophile sting operation.

Here's just some of the stories included:

- Believing in Santa Claus far to late in life
- Feeling suicidal guilt for playing with myself as a kid
- Being told Dungeons and Dragons was the reason Satan visiting me in my sleep
- A Mormon I knew fucking those "in need" that he was "home teaching"
- A Mormon I knew straight-jacketed after psychotic break running naked down the highway
- Mormons nearly dying in childbirth because "birth-control bad"
- My Bishop and "advocate" arrested for soliciting sex with minor in Florida
- Ex-wife lying about my sons meeting with accused bishop in private
- Learning Joseph Smith stuck his face in a hat to "receive inspiration"
- Learning Joseph Smith fucked a 13-year-old and hid it from wife 'cuz God said
- Enacting ways to disembowel myself rather than reveal my secret Mormon name
- Trans woman I knew raised Mormon fighting depression her whole life
- A Mormon I knew finally marrying the love of his life, in Canada
- Mormon boys having sex with girls then trashing them so they could go on mission
- Falling in love with a teacher who loved me for me, not my Mormonism
- Stalked by drug lord on Martinique after baptising his wife
- Committing myself to mental hospital after losing it learning it was all a lie
- Nearly being washed away in hurricanes
- Dodging machetes from angry islanders trying to kill my idiot mission companion
- Saving a dumb ass who wouldn't listen to me as a river guide
- Hitchhiking 400 miles to meet my would-be fiance
- Translating for drunk, scarred mob boss and company CFO trying to kick him out
- Meeting American spies in Russia while at church
- Nearly being arrested in Nishni Novgorod for using CompuServe
- Body guarding for Samantha Fox tour in Russia
- Making my own 80s Levi jackets with cloth fringe and chasing down the thieves

_Some day I'll get to the rest of this..._
