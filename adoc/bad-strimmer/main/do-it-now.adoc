== Do it now, don't procrastinate

Here's a list of things that I would never do unless it did it immediately:

- Publish a recorded video
- Edit a long video (better to just make another shorter one)
- Add chapter markers in the YouTube VOD
- Put zettelkasten pages into a blog or book

You could hire people to do this for you, or you could be a bad strimmer with an actual job and no time for such things.
