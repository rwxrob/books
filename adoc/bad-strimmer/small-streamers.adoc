== Small streamers

There's something infectious about being a very small streamer to a certain type of person. Some of my favorite interactions and friendships are when only 2-10 people were in the stream. It's almost as if a certain type of person is attracted to really tiny streamers. I miss it, actually. I've never averaged over 70 people. The one time I had 3000 people in my stream I felt like my stream died because I was no longer able to distinguish my regular friends from the masses. There's a lesson to be learned in there somewhere.

I'm not exaggerating when I say that I felt a sense of panic when I lost contact with my regulars, drowned out by the masses of anonymous, emoji-posting strangers.
