Here you'll find my perpetually unfinished books. Check for updates at the bottom. If you link directly to stuff just know those links will likely break when I move things around (Tim Berners-Lee's biggest complaint about the Web that he created). Feel free to https://github.com/rwxrob/books/issues[give your feedback] or https://github.com/sponsors/rwxrob[sponsor] if you like.
