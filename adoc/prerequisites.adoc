= Prerequisites

Stop. Don't read another word until you have:

- A computer with an American keyboard on which you can install software
- A phone for research and reading while working
- A reliable Internet connection for installing and saving
- An email account that you control
- The ability to type 30 words per minute from home row
- Enough snacks to keep you from getting hangry

Mac, Windows, or Linux are all fine. A laptop is best since you can code anywhere, like when fleeing from your enemies. _Wink._

There. I hope that didn't sound to harsh—or weird. It's a time thing. I value mine—and yours. No sense wasting it reading this if you aren't ready—or worse—you don't like my rhetorical style. I'm not selling time-shares here.
