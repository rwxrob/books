== Perpetual publishing approach

=== Advantages over zettelkasten

=== Managing knowledge as source code

==== Open source required to follow

==== Git based to dynamically show changes

==== Enables crowd sourcing, but beware

Don't lose all the reasons that people sometimes prefer a book.

=== Combatting distributions of old copies

=== What about other people distributing my content as their?

=== What about it being constantly out of date?

Is any website actually up to date? The difference is openly stating up front that your public book is perpetually out of date manages the expectation better.

=== Not just throwing something into zettelkasten and never getting back to it

=== Only has to be one line idea at first, but placement is initially correct
