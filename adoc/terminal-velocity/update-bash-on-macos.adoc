= Update bash on Mac

Alright, macOS is Unix. It ships with bash. But here's the catch: it's old—*real* old. Apple stopped updating bash beyond version 3.2 because of licensing drama. If you want to run scripts like it's the 21st century, you need the latest bash. Don't worry, though, we're fixing that right now.

== Install Homebrew

First things first—if you don't have Homebrew, your Mac's missing the single most powerful tool it can have. Open Terminal by typing `Command + Space` and typing `terminal` and drop this in:

[source,bash]
----
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
----

Let brew do its thing. When it's done, confirm it's installed:

[source,bash]
----
brew --version
----

If you see a version number, you're good to go.

== Install bash with brew

Next, use Homebrew to install the latest version of bash. Run:

[source,bash]
----
brew install bash
----

That's it—new bash installed. But wait, you're not done yet.

== Add bash to the shell list

Your Mac still doesn't know the new bash exists. You've got to tell it. First, find where Homebrew installed bash:

[source,bash]
----
brew --prefix
----

This will give you a path like `/opt/homebrew`. Add `/opt/homebrew/bin/bash` (or similar) to your list of allowed shells:

[source,bash]
----
sudo echo "$(brew --prefix)/bin/bash" >> /etc/shells
----

This will append a line to the bottom of the file. Use the `tail` command to look at the last line:

[source,bash]
----
tail -1 /etc/shells
----

== Make bash your default shell

Now it's time to switch. Set the new bash as your default shell:

[source,bash]
----
chsh -s $(brew --prefix)/bin/bash
----

Log out and back in, or just open a new terminal window. Check which Bash you’re using now:

[source,bash]
----
echo $SHELL
----

It should point to something besides `/bin/bash`.

== Check your current bash version

Check the Bash version to make sure you're running the latest:

[source,bash]
----
bash --version
----

If you see something like `5.x.x`, congratulations—you're on modern bash.
