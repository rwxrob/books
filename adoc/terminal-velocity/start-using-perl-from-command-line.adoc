There's no more powerful command line language than Perl—yes, even now. Watch any senior hacker for a while and you will see that they regularly use Perl from the command line to do things way more efficiently and simply than they would in sed, awk, or tr. This is because Perl was specifically created by Larry Wall to replace the complete disaster that became the awk/nawk/gawk ecosytem. Even today not all sed commands behave the same. Most of them finally agreed to use extended regular expressions, but not all. Perl, on the other hand, is the undisputed winner of regular expression syntax with PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) being used by *every major language on the planet*—usually quite directly with `libpcre.*`.
