[[get-unix-linux]]
= Get Unix or Linux

Let's make this short. If you have a Mac you're done. Just update stuff with `brew`. If you have Windows, install WSL2 and you're in the game. That's it. Both of these are mandatory learning for any hacker. Add them to your `TODO` lists now. That said, there are still a few alternative ways to get Linux. We'll _briefly_ talk about how that is done without getting into the details. You can get to that later.

We also have to talk about getting the software you need and keeping it up to date, a thing called a _package manager_. Learn it. Use it. You'll save tons of time.
