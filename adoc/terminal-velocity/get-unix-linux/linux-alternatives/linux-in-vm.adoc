=== Linux in virtual machine

The next best thing to a machine is a _virtual_ machine. We'll get into that whole "virtualisation" thing in _Linux homelab init_ later. But here's how it works:

- **Step 1:** Download a Linux distro ISO (like Ubuntu, Fedora, or Archâ€”your choice).
- **Step 2:** Download a virtual machine engine (like UTM for Mac or VMWare for Windows).
- **Step 3:** Open the VM engine app and create a new VM pointing to the downloaded ISO.
- **Step 4:** Set the VM networking to "bridged" so appears on your home network.
- **Step 5:** Start up your new VM and work through the installer.
- **Step 6:** Setup secure shell and `ssh` into your new VM.

[CAUTION]
====
A VM by its very nature has no access to your host system so you can forget about automating things on your computer using it. Something as simple as opening a file or a web URL with your graphic web browser are impossible in a VM (unless you use a full desktop VM, but why, seriously).
