== Alt Linux

Since you're just starting out, stick with WSL2 on Windows or macOS's built-in Unix core. They're easy to set up, give you immediate access to the command line, and let you focus on learning Linux without diving into the deep end. Save the heavy lifting—VMs, containers, or bare metal installs—for when you're ready to level up. But here's a taste. Consider it extra credit for later after you've hacked your A grade.

=== Hacker's perspective

Linux isn't just an operating system—it's a choice, a weapon, and the foundation of everything that matters in tech. How you run it—on bare metal, inside a virtual machine, or spun up in a container—says a lot about how you operate. Bare metal is raw power and total control. Virtual machines give you the flexibility to experiment without risking your system. Containers? They're precision tools for rapid deployment and isolation. Each method is a different path into the same world, and knowing when to use which is what separates the pros from the amateurs. This isn't just about running Linux; it's about running it your way.
