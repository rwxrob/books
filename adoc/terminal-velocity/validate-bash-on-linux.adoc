= Validate bash on Linux

Alright, you're on a Linux distro that uses `apt`, so you’ve already got Bash. That's a good start, but let's make sure you've got the latest version and a clean setup.

== Check your current bash version

Open your terminal and run:

[source,bash]
----
bash --version
----

You should see something like `5.x.x`. If it's already up-to-date, skip to *Step 4*. If it's not, let’s fix that.

== Update your software repositories

Make sure your package lists are up-to-date so you can fetch the latest versions of everything:

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
----

This also upgrades your current Bash if the distro maintains a newer version in the repositories. Check the version again with:

[source,bash]
----
bash --version
----

== Make bash your default shell

Double-check that bash is your default shell:

[source,bash]
----
echo $SHELL
----

If it doesn’t show `/bin/bash`, set it:

[source,bash]
----
chsh -s /bin/bash
----

Log out and back in, or restart your terminal.
