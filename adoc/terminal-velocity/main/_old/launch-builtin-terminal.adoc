== Launch builtin terminal

For the rest of these preparation steps we will need a terminal. The terminal is the mage’s staff—a powerful tool for casting commands, managing your environment, and creating magic in the digital realm. Here’s how to launch the native terminal on Mac, Windows, and Linux, so you can start your journey as a Code Mage.

[NOTE]
====
Don't get to invested in the native terminal. We'll replace it with customized Alacritty later, which is faster and easier to use but just needs to be installed.

You've already learned how to launch things using the launcher. Just use the right application name as follows:

- Mac: `terminal`
- Win: `powershell`
- Linux: `terminal`

Take a moment to increase the font size to something you can read just for this session while we install everything else including the Alacritty terminal and its custom configuration.
