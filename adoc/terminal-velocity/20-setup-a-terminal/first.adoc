= Your first terminal

Welcome to the first step. Forget the noise, the guides, the endless rabbit holes of config tweaks. All of that? It can wait. Right now, we're here to do one thing: get your terminal up and running. Nothing fancy. No frills. Just power, raw and ready.

This isn't about perfection; it's about initiation. You don't need the perfect `.vimrc` or a color scheme that makes your heart sing. That's for later. First, we open the door. Later, we'll learn everything you need to grok and hack your configs to your hearts content.

Weâ€™ll get there. One step at a time.
