= Prerequisites

There's not much you can do without a CPU. Don't read another word until you have:

- A computer with an American keyboard on which you can install software
- A phone for research and reading while working
- A reliable Internet connection for installing and saving
- An email account that you control
- The ability to type 30 words per minute from home row
- Enough snacks and drinks to keep you from getting hangry

Windows, macOS, Linux? All are fine. A CPU's a CPU. Ignore fights about which OS is best. You have better things to do.
