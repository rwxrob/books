== What's included in the book

So, what's in this book? Everything you need to start, and nothing you don't. This isn't some bloated manual crammed with fluff. Every page is designed to sharpen your edge, to give you the skills you need to move faster, work smarter, and take control. These are the foundational building blocks of your `skilstak`. The rest? You’ll build it.

This book is divided into six parts:

. Get Unix or Linux
. Start using terminal
. Create lab repo
. Grok your configs
. Code for the terminal
. Plan your next op

There is also additional secondarily relevant content in the appendix.

=== Get Unix or Linux

There's not much you can do without a CPU. And the best computer operating system for that CPU is Unix or Linux. But how do you hack on a Windows or a Mac? The hacker's dilemma.

[CAUTION]
====
Don't let the install process slow you down. The system you're using _right now_ is enough to get started. Dive in, learn the commands, break things. Master the environment first—bare hands in the terminal. The distro wars? The dual boot debates? They'll still be there when you're ready to level up. Right now, it's about ops, not aesthetics. Don't waste time decorating your bunker when you haven't learned to fire the weapon. Just get in. The rest will follow.

Besides, people won't suspect you're a skilled hacker carrying around a corporate Windows laptop. Think of it as camouflage.

==== Linux on metal

The lucky ones running are already running Linux on bare metal. They're already free from the chains of Windows. No bloated background processes, no endless updates hijacking their workflow—just raw power, precision, and control. Their machine doesn't just run; it listens, ready to do exactly what they need, exactly when they need it. If that's you, congrats. You're starting ahead of the game. But don't expect me to show you how to install Linux on your computer, yet. That'll come later, in another book: _Linux homelab init_.

==== macOS is Unix

macOS is the largest Unix distro on the planet, a moniker for this they pay 10s of thousands of dollars every year to be audited for Unix compliance. So yeah, it's a Unix system with a custom desktop environment.

==== Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)

You can't escape learning Windows—the most vulnerable operating system on planet Earth. So using one now is fine. It's not 'real' Linux, sure—but who cares? It runs the commands, compiles the code, gets the job done. This isn't about proving you can partition a drive or wrangle bootloaders. It's about getting into the fight. WSL2 gets you there.

==== Software package managers

Every OS has a package manager. Knowing how to install, update, and remove software using nothing but a single command is essential:

- `brew` - macOS
- `winget` - Windows
- `apt` - Linux including WSL2

=== Start using terminal

Upgrading your terminal and integrating core terminal tools isn't just an enhancement—its a game-changer:

- `bash` - universal command shell and scripting language
- `wezterm` - fast and dynamically configurable terminal
- `git`/`gh` - save, share, distribute your source code
- `nano`/`ed`/`ex`/`vi`/`vim`/`nvim` - terminal text editors at your fingertips
- `screen`/`tmux` - who needs a window manager when you have a multiplexer
- `w3m`/`lynx` - terminal web browsers for lightening fast research
- `mods`/`?` - Claude AI assistant integration from the command line
- `duck`/`??` - duckduckgo.com queries from the command line
- `google`/`???` - google.com queries from the command line
- `weechat` - OG IRC chat client with authenticated Twitch integration

Together, this setup transforms the terminal into a high-performance, multi-tool powerhouse. It’s not just worth it—it’s essential for anyone serious about speed, efficiency, and taking control of their environment.

=== Create lab repo

A lab repo isn't just a folder—it's your personal codebook, your digital sanctum. It's where ideas are born, tested, and sharpened. Markdown notes document the chaos, while the code tells the story of your experiments, your breakthroughs, your failures. It's not about just saving files; it's about building a map of your learning, linking thought to execution. This isn't documentation—it's a blueprint for hacking the future, one test, one script, one revelation at a time.

=== Grok your configs

Once you have a working terminal, a lab, and some dotfiles, it's time the master config dialects:

- bash - universal command shell and scripting language
- JSON - structured data that powers web APIs and more
- YAML - JSON on steroids powering all of enterprise computing
- TOML - a better INI format [I made the https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/pull/408[logo], btw]
- Lua - dynamic config in the world's most embeddable language.
- Vimscript - just enough—ugly, horrible, and required

[CAUTION]
====
Don't like coding in different languages? At least now you know. Put the book down and walk away.
====

While learning these essential dialects we'll dissecting your configs. You'll know every single line so you can tailor it to your liking.

=== Code for the terminal

Bash and Go aren’t just tools—they’re the stuff tools are made of. Bash gives you raw, direct control over your system, letting you script and shape your environment in real time. Go takes it further, letting you craft fast, reliable binaries, with embedded resources and payloads, that can automate, extend, and evolve your workflows—even fill in when there's no OS at all. Compiled Go code can run as _setuid_. Scripts cannot. Hackers start here because these languages aren’t just for using tools—they’re for creating them. With Bash and Go, you’re not just working in the system—you’re defining it.

==== Bash

We already learned enough bash for your configs. Now it's time to really master more than most ever will. Wanna taste? How about the 270 page `man bash`. Don't worry. Most of it is completely useless.

==== Go

When it comes to cross-compiling gorgeous apps quickly that run with blazing speed in the terminal there's no better language than Go. We'll learn all the main stuff plus the standard packages that make creating commands painless and powerful:

- Bonzai - beautiful, command trees with completion, persistent variables, and more
- Cobra - world's most widely adopted command line Go framework (even though it sucks)
- Tview - terminal layout library with forms, dialogs, etc.
- Tcell - think of the terminal as a screen with a bunch of cells as large pixels
- Bubbletea - reactive terminal apps that feel modern at the cost of complexity

Don't worry. I won't assume you have ever written a line of code before. But don't expect a full computer science course. We're hackers, not algorithm-obsessed academics with tenured time to waste.

=== Plan your next op

Remember this book just boosts you to _terminal velocity_. (I never tire of saying that.) What next? What's behind the metaphorical doors you'll lock pick in this never-ending text adventure of learning:

- What do you want to do with your life?
- What are the best jobs for hackers like us?
- Do you even need a job?
- Should you get a job and where?
- What languages should you learn next?
- How do I practice hacking safely?
- How can I setup my home lab?
- How can you keep up on your learning?
- Will you ever find love?
- Are we all dreaming or in a big simulation?
