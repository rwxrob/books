=== Hacker first, coder second

In the series _Silicon Valley_, there are two fictional characters: Dinesh Chugtai and Bertram Gilfoyle. Dinesh is a talented, self-titled software engineer who codes almost exclusively in Java and is constantly trying to prove he's just as good as Gilfoyle. Gilfoyle, on the other hand, is a confident sigma hacker—a master of multiple coding languages, including Java, which he accidentally convinces Dinesh to fawn over. He builds a supercomputer in the garage named Anton, and his skills go far beyond just software development.

To put it bluntly, this book is for Gilfoyles—not Dineshs. If all you want out of tech is a big salary at a company that forces you through an irrelevant leet-code whiteboard session and expects endless hours grinding code in a digital sweatshop, then this book isn’t for you.

Thinking like a hacker isn't just about breaking into systems; it's about breaking out of limitations. A hacker sees a problem and doesn't just look for a predefined solution—they reimagine what's possible. This mindset fosters creativity, adaptability, and a deeper understanding of how systems work, empowering you to craft innovative solutions and uncover new uses for existing tools. A software developer might follow a spec and deliver functional code, but a hacker thinks beyond the spec, finding edge cases, optimizing workflows, and pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve. In a world where agility and innovation reign, the terminal hacker's mindset is the ultimate competitive advantage.
