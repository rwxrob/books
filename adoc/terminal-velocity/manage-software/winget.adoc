== Windows: winget

Windows finally has a native package manager: *winget* (Windows Package Manager). It simplifies the process of installing, updating, and managing software directly from the command line, just like package managers on Unix-like systems. Here’s how you can master the basics.

=== Installing winget

Most modern versions of Windows 10 and 11 already have *winget* installed. To check, open PowerShell or Command Prompt and run:

[source,powershell]
----
winget --version
----

If you see a version number, you’re good to go. If not, install it via the *Microsoft Store* by searching for the *App Installer*.

=== Common winget commands

Find the package you want by searching the repository:

[source,powershell]

winget search --id <package-id>
