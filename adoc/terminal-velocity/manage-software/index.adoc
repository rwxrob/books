[[manage-software]]
= Manage installed software

Package management is the backbone of software installation, updates, and maintenance on Unix (macOS) and Linux (WSL2, Ubuntu, etc.).

[NOTE]
====
Unix and Linux have been using package management since the 90s, `rpm`, `yum`, `dnf`, `zypper`, `emerge`, `installp`, `pkg`,`apk`, `pacman`. Native Windows has even joined in with the official `winget` command-line package management.
