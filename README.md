# Books

Here you'll find Rob's perpetually unfinished books and the `rwxrob-book` multicall binary [Bonzai](https://github.com/rwxrob/bonzai) command including the Code-Mage assistant app. Feel free to [complain](https://github.com/rwxrob/books/issues) or [support him](https://github.com/sponsors/rwxrob).

The monorepo is nice because I can include sections in each book rather than repeat them if they are identical (such as how to start a terminal session). It also allows the building of applications that embed the content of the books.
